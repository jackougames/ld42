# Welcome to SpaceRunner

This game has been developed by [Moritz Kirstein](https://twitter.com/JackousGames) during the [Ludum Dare](https://ldjam.com) #42 Game Jam (Compo)with the Theme: "Running out of space".

### Intro to the game
You have been sent on a mission to gather resources in space. With the aim to get back to earth as quickly as possible your are literally trying to run out of space and reach your rocket. You can however only travel small distances from planet to planet until eventually you will be able to reach the earth.
Movement up in space is different than on earth so you were smart enough to bring a jetpack! Be carefull though: Manage your fuel charges and use the jetpack with care. There are obstacles that you else you not overcome.
Aim for as many resources as you can get, those make up your primary score.

### Controls
With the theme in mind I went for a "space" focussed control system. All you need to play the game is the spacebar!
* Hit `[SPACE]` to jump and
* Hit `[SPACE]` to use jetpack while in air
